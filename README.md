Music player powered that uses Vk, YouTube, Soundcloud and other sites to download music.  While also using Xbox Music and Last.fm for song, artist and album information.

## Requirements

Makes sure to create the file `ApiKeys.cs` and fill it with the content in the sample file, using your own keys.

Audiotica uses my fork of the XboxMusicClient SDK.  The binary is already in the Dependencies folder. But you can also download the source [here](https://github.com/zumicts/XboxMusicClient) or get the binary [here](https://github.com/zumicts/XboxMusicClient/releases/latest).  Should be unnecessary as I maintain the binary.

The music library is powered by SQLite.  You'll need both [WinRT 8.1](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/1d04f82f-2fe9-4727-a2f9-a2db127ddc9a) and [WinPRT 8.1](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5d97faf6-39e3-4048-a0bc-adde2af75d1b) installed in your computer.
